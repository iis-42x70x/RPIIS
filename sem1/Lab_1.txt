account by the developer at the time of creation of
the computer system and are laid in its program code
in the form of ready-made structures created under the
influence of the model of communication with the user,
the model of the environment, the model of the user
and the proposed algorithm for solving the problem.
Often this modeling process does not lead to an optimal
result. In addition, computer systems tend to receive new
functions within their life cycle, which entails updating
the user interface, which in turn leads to repeated manual
design of the user interface taking into account all the
factors described above.\par
User interfaces of computer systems are suboptimal
largely because the toolkit for creating user interfaces
with tools to solve the problems described above is not
sufficiently refined, versatile, or widespread. In order to
create a complete interface development toolkit, it is
necessary to describe the mechanisms of system-human
communication, in particular, to define the classes of
transmitted messages in order to build a model of human
communication based on the task facing the system. It is
also necessary to describe what components of the user
interface implement certain messages between the system
and the user; describe relevant properties of the user and
the environment, and automate the rules by which the
user interface should change in the presence of certain
properties of the environment or the user. Thus, formalize
the experience of experts in building user interfaces and
turn it into an automated algorithm. Such a tool would
have the ability to generate an interface for systems with
dynamic problem formulation, adapt and personalize the
interface to the user and the environment.

\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral3.} Proposed approach \par
\end{end}
\medskip
\textit{A. General principles of building adaptive user interfaces of intelligent systems.} \par
An ontological approach based on the semantic model
proposed in [3] is suggested to build adaptive user
interfaces of intelligent systems. This approach assumes:\par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item "lexical" interface description — a description of
the components from which the interface is formed;\par
\item "syntactic" description of an interface — rules for
forming a correct interface from its components;\par
\item semantic description. Knowledge about what entity
the displayed component is a sign of. The semantic
description also includes the purpose, scope of
application of the interface components, description
of the user’s interface activity, etc. The semantic
description also includes the purpose, scope of
application of the interface components, description
of the user’s interface activity, etc.\par
\end{itemize}
The following ontologies need to be implemented
within the approach:\par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item ontology of problems and algorithms for their solution; \par
\item ontology of user interfaces of intelligent computer
systems; \par
\item ontology of components of user interfaces of intelligent computer systems; \par
\item ontology of the context of use of user interfaces of intelligent computer systems; \par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item ontology of users of intelligent computer systems;\par
\item ontology of intelligent computer systems users’
actions;\par
\item ontology of the environment of intelligent computer systems; \par
\item ontology of devices of intelligent computer systems; \par
\end{itemize}
• ontology of external information constructs; \par
• ontology of incoming and outgoing messages of
intelligent computer systems. \par
\end{itemize}
\medskip
In addition to the proposed ontologies, it is necessary
to develop tools for automatic interface generation and
editing of its model to enable interface modification
during operation and tools to support the design of user
interfaces. \par
The above means are also proposed to be realized
with the help of the above ontologies, which allow to
fully describe in the knowledge base of the intelligent
system both the interface itself and the principles of its
interaction with the user, as well as the mechanisms of
adaptation of the interface depending on the user and
the environment. It is important to note that algorithms
for solving user tasks are also proposed to be formed
dynamically in the knowledge base of the system.\par
\medskip
The application of this approach requires a basis in
the form of intelligent systems design technology, which
allows solving complex problems and whose components
integrate with each other and have a synergistic effect.
In turn, the application of the ontological method of
building adaptive user interfaces within the framework of
such technology will make intelligent systems practically
applicable for a large number of classes of tasks.\par
The technology that meets these requirements is the
OSTIS Technology. Intelligent systems developed according to the OSTIS Technology are called ostis-systems [10].\par
The advantages of the OSTIS Technology are as
follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item  unification of different types of knowledge with the
help of SC-code;
\item ontological approach to knowledge structuring;
\item  availability of a variant of realization of the platform
of interpretation of semantic models of intellectual
systems (sc-models);
\item problem solver is based on a multi-agent approach
in which agents interact with each other solely by
specifying the actions they perform in a shared
semantic memory;
\item library of reusable knowledge base components and
problem solvers;
\item the possibility of semantic representation of logical
formulas and statements;
\item availability of a variant of implementation of the
interpreter of logical models of problem solving.
\end{itemize}
The OSTIS Technology allows to implement the user
interface in the simplest and most efficient way due to the
use of automation tools for the design of user interface
components, as well as due to the library of reusable
components of ostis-systems, which significantly reduces
the time of interface development [11].\par
The main ostis-system within the OSTIS Ecosystem
is the OSTIS Metasystem [12]. The OSTIS Metasystem
allows to automate the development of ostis-systems and
their components, including user interfaces [13].\par
The internal universal language of knowledge representation is SC-code [14]. With the help of SC-code the
interface of ostis-systems itself and the programs and
rules that are used when using the interface are recorded
in a unified way. That is, using SC-code, it is possible to
write the interface, and also the program which can not
only implement some business logic of system, but also
the program which will change the interface itself which
is used at interaction with the user. Through the use of
SC-code and the principles of the OSTIS Technology it
is possible to realize the adaptability of user interfaces
in the simplest and most flexible way.\par
To implement the user interface as a subsystem with its
own knowledge base and problem solver, it is necessary
to develop the listed family of user interface ontologies,
as well as a collective of agents for the functioning of
the user interface:\par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item  non-atomic sc-agent of interpreting sc-model of user
interfaces of ostis-systems;
\item non-atomic sc-agent of generation of sc-model of
user interface of ostis-systems;
\item non-atomic sc-agent of adaptation of sc-model of
user interface of ostis-systems to a particular user
and external environment;
\item non-atomic sc-agent of interpretation of user actions; user interfaces of ostis-systems.
\end{itemize}
\textit{B. User interface module for ostis-systems}\par
\smallskip
The implementation of the user interface of ostissystems is based on:\par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item  extensibility without the need to change the logic of
the module (for personalization and adaptation on
the part of the user and for styling and fine-tuning
on the part of the system developer);
\item maximum simplification for developers to add a new
user interface platform (other than the current weboriented);
\item ensuring the simplest possible integration of the UI
module into existing systems;
\item ensuring that the final interface is comparable in
speed to user interfaces developed by traditional
means;
\item support for a high level of abstraction for operating
user interface objects, thus not limiting developers
using any means to communicate with users (including virtual reality helmets or interaction with real
world objects).\par
\medskip
\end{itemaze}
In this regard, the following architectural decisions have
been made:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item to implement the functionality of translating the scmodel of the user interface into a specific platformdependent markup on the side of the ostis-systems
problem solver;
\item to implement the functionality of user actions interpretation on the side of ostis-systems problem
solver;
\item to implement a mechanism to track updates to the
user interface model and pass only the changed part
of the markup to the user interface implementation
platform;
\item to use a web-oriented platform as the first supported
platform for user interface implementation;
\item not to use web primitives to describe interfaces,
but to limit ourselves to higher-level concepts and
relations, such as size, algorithm of mutual arrangement, decomposition of a user interface element
(an example of the description of the "Button"
component is presented in Figure \ref{fig:enter-label});
\item to provide the possibility of applying the rules of
user interface adaptation defined declaratively in the
knowledge base of ostis-systems.
\end{itemize}
\par
The general architecture of the module is presented in
Figure 2.\par
The order of interaction can be described as follows:\par
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item the user interacts with the user interface of the ostissystem to solve the task he/she needs;
\item  information about the interaction is transferred to
the knowledge base of the system;
\item initiation of a team of agents to solve the user’s task
is performed;
\item results of the user’s task solution are stored in the
system’s knowledge base;
\item the user interface agent collective is initiated;
\item user interface agents modify the interface model in 
the knowledge base based on the received information about the result of the performed task as well
as the current usage context;
\item as a result, adaptation is performed - the user
interface model in the knowledge base of the system
is changed;
\item changing the user interface model in the knowledge
base of the system leads to an updated visualization
of the user interface.
\end{itemize}

Description of user’s action takes place in the knowl
edge base of the system. An example of formalization of
 a single button press is shown in Figure 3. The sequence
 of click-based UI updates is shown in Figure 4.\par
 The algorithm for updating the UI after a user action
 involves the following steps:\par
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
 \item 1) The user performs the action of pressing the button.
 \item 2) The user interface captures information about the
 user’s action in the system’s knowledge base.
\item 3) When this information appears, the user action
 interpretation agent (UIActionAgent) is initiated.
\item 4) This agent searches the knowledge base for an
 internal system action that should be executed as
 a result of pressing a button. The search is based on
 information about the class of the user action and
 the UI component for which it was initiated.
\item 5) Having received a template for creating an internal
 action in the system’s knowledge base, UiActionA
gent initiates its execution.
\item 6) An internal system action is performed. If necessary,
 the user interface model in the knowledge base is
 changed.
\item 7) An UpdateModelAgent call is executed to update
 the user interface model.
\item 8) For each modified component of the user interface,
 the agent of forming a visualization of this compo
nent for the used platform is called.
\item 9) The modified part of the user interface is redrawn.
 The key components of the module are:
 \end{description}
 \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item  User interface sc-model generator. It is responsible
 for compiling requirements for the current state of
 the user interface based on the solution step of the
 current task. Based on the solution algorithm, the
 generator finds a set of input information received
 from the user and a set of elements on which it
 is necessary to give feedback. Further, the genera
tor specifies the types of received information and
 feedback, searches for the most general classes of
 user interface components that solve the problem of
 input and output of information for this particular
 task and creates/modifies the sc-model of the user
 interface containing all the necessary elements.
  \item SC-model adaptation agent. It is responsible for
 adding the properties necessary for interpretation to
 the user interface components (e.g. size, color of
 elements, their location, etc.) based on the system
 settings, knowledge about the environment and rules
 of adaptation to the environment, knowledge about
 the user and rules of adaptation to certain user
 characteristics.
  \item Interpreter. It converts a specific user interface sc
model into an external language compatible with the
 user interface implementation platform, so that the
 user interface can be recreated on the platform or
 the state of an existing interface can be updated.
  \item User action interpreter. It obtains information about
 user interactions with the interface and triggers the
 system to perform the action described in the user
